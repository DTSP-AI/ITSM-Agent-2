## ü§ñ Agent Capabilities

### Supervisor Agent (Central Hub)
The main orchestrator that integrates Kevin's Assistant functionality:

**Kevin's Assistant Functions:**
- **Email Processing**: Automated categorization, priority scoring, and action suggestions
- **Calendar Management**: Intelligent scheduling with conflict detection and optimization
- **Commercial Advisory**: Market intelligence and project tracking for commercial developments
- **Recovery Advisory**: Post-disaster recovery monitoring (Helene/Milton operations)

**Executive Coordination:**
- Routes complex workflows to specialized agents
- Provides unified status monitoring
- Handles cross-functional operations

### Recruitment Department Agent
Consolidated recruitment pipeline handling:
- **Sourcing**: Zoho Zia candidate suggestions with custom scraping fallback
- **Qualification**: FL-DBPR license verification + Zia skill matching + composite scoring
- **Engagement**: Calendar scheduling + email/SMS communications via VAPI
- **Full Pipeline**: End-to-end automated recruitment workflow

### Compliance Executive Agent
Consolidated compliance operations:
- **Document Intake**: Automated processing with PDF parsing and classification
- **Signature Validation**: SOP compliance checking against document requirements
- **Commission Verification**: Mathematical + regulatory validation with split agreement checks
- **Disbursement Readiness**: Cross-system verification before payouts

## LangGraph Orchestration

The system uses **LangGraph** for sophisticated workflow orchestration with state management, parallel processing, and adaptive routing.

### Workflow Architecture

```
Request ‚Üí Router ‚Üí [Recruitment|Compliance|Kevin Assistant] ‚Üí Aggregator ‚Üí Response
```

### State Management

The graph uses typed state management for different workflow types:

```python
# Base workflow state
WorkflowState: messages, request_type, status, results, errors, metadata

# Specialized states
RecruitmentState: candidates, qualification_results, engagement_metrics
ComplianceState: deal_id, documents, validation_results, compliance_score
KevinAssistantState: emails, calendar_events, advisory_data, recommendations
```

### Graph Features

#### 1. **Conditional Routing**
```python
# Routes based on request type
{
    "recruitment": "recruitment_pipeline",
    "compliance": "compliance_pipeline", 
    "kevin_assistant": "kevin_assistant",
    "error": "error_handler"
}
```

#### 2. **Parallel Processing**
- Candidate qualification in parallel
- Compliance checks executed simultaneously  
- Kevin's daily briefing components processed concurrently

#### 3. **Error Handling & Recovery**
- Graceful error handling with recovery suggestions
- Detailed error analysis and logging
- Automatic retry mechanisms for transient failures

#### 4. **Workflow Monitoring**
- Real-time progress tracking
- Performance metrics collection
- System load monitoring for adaptive routing

### API Usage Examples

#### Recruitment Request
```json
POST /api/supervisor
{
    "type": "recruitment",
    "action": "run_full_pipeline",
    "criteria": {
        "target_count": 15,
        "geo_targets": ["Tampa", "St_Petersburg"],
        "experience_min_years": 3
    }
}
```

#### Compliance Request  
```json
POST /api/supervisor
{
    "type": "compliance",
    "action": "full_compliance_check",
    "deal_id": "deal_12345"
}
```

#### Kevin's Assistant Request
```json
POST /api/supervisor
{
    "type": "kevin_assistant", 
    "action": "daily_briefing"
}
```

### Parallel Workflow Execution

For efficiency, multiple workflows can be executed in parallel:

```python
from backend.graphs.graph import execute_parallel_workflows

workflows = [
    {"type": "recruitment", "action": "source_candidates", "criteria": {...}},
    {"type": "compliance", "action": "verify_commission", "deal_id": "deal_123"},
    {"type": "kevin_assistant", "action": "process_emails"}
]

results = await execute_parallel_workflows(supervisor, workflows)
```

### Environment-Specific Graphs

The system supports different graph configurations for different environments:

```python
from backend.graphs.graph import create_graph_for_environment

# Development: Simple graph with detailed logging
dev_graph = create_graph_for_environment(supervisor, "development")

# Production: Enhanced graph with persistence and monitoring  
prod_graph = create_graph_for_environment(supervisor, "production")

# Testing: Simplified graph with mock components
test_graph = create_graph_for_environment(supervisor, "testing")
```

### Workflow State Persistence

In production, workflows can be persisted for recovery and audit trails:

```python
# Enable state persistence
enhanced_graph = create_enhanced_graph(supervisor, enable_persistence=True)

# Workflows can be resumed after interruptions
# State is automatically checkpointed at each node
```

### Advanced Features

#### 1. **Adaptive Routing**
Routes requests based on system load and performance metrics.

#### 2. **Workflow Composition**
Complex workflows can be composed from simpler building blocks.

#### 3. **Event-Driven Processing**
Supports event-driven workflows for real-time processing.

#### 4. **Integration Monitoring**
Monitors external API performance and automatically retries failed calls.
